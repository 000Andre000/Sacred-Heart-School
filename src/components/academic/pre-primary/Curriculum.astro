        The Foundational Stage (Nursery, Junior and Senior Kindergarten) follows
        the CBSE Curriculum in adherence to the National Education Policy (NEP)
        2020. We focus on holistic development through play-based learning,
        nurturing the young learners to be caring and recognizing their
        potential to explore, inquire, question, wonder, and â€˜theorize about
        themselves, others, and the world around them. <br /><br />The
        curriculum covers Literacy, Numeracy, Environmental Studies (EVS),
        Hindi, General Awareness, Social Skills, Dance, Sports, Music, Drawing
        and Craft. Our approach incorporates the well-regarded Jolly Phonics
        method, creating a dynamic and interactive foundation for literacy.
        Introduction to the Hindi language early in Nursery to facilitate
        language acquisition. Moreover, we design activities that encourage
        joyful and hands-on learning experiences for our students.
