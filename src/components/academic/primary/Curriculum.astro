    At Sacred Heart School, the Pre-Preparatory Stage (Grades 1 and 2) and the
    Preparatory Stage (Grades 3 and 4) adhere to the CBSE Curriculum in line
    with the NEP 2020 and NCF 2023. Our approach focuses on making learning
    enjoyable, fostering a scientific mindset through activity-based teaching
    and learning materials (TLM), and nurturing every child through a holistic
    educational experience.
